<p id="p1">Duty: As a personal injury plaintiff their first job of the attorney is to show
that the defendant owed you a duty of care.
During the trial Brockovich states that the companies never took into
consideration the people that lived in the community around them and
there is clear evidence that shows that in fact they did dump the hazardous
material in the ponds which polluted the underground water and reached
the water of Hinkley. The judge states that he is shocked at the fact that
PG&E knew what they were doing and that PG&E held a meeting with the
people living in Hinkley telling the that they were using chromium 3 and it
would be beneficial when in reality they were using chromium 6.</p>

<p id="p2">Breach:Attorney must show that the defendant breached the duty of care
that he/she owed you.
After the judge denied the 84 motions of PG&E. The PG&E lawyers met
with the firm in which Brockovich works. PG&E sent their representatives
to try and make a settlement. They are in a way pleading guilty because
they are trying to convince them to agree to the settlement to not go to
trial.</p>
